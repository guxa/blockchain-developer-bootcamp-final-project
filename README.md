# Final project idea
## Background
Connecting people to activities of interest which they and their friends can afford. Living in this era has provided a lot of people with the perks of working from home, working remotely from anywhere in the world, but this has decreased time people socialize in person, and soared the number of people facing burnouts. This dapp will try (: to force people to spend some quality time with other people in their circle.

## Description
1.  At registration the user can pldegde a certain amount of funds in a smart contract "Good times contract" or GTC. When making a deposit, the user can also provide an arbitrary username, which will be noted in the system. That "username" and the address that they use to deposit these funds will be used to "connect" them to their circle of humans. Later if they deposit funds to the same GTC contract from other address that one also will be included in the system and appended with the initial username.

2. Users can also provide the eth addresses of people in their circle who they wish to travel with. This will be some kind of a contact list.

3. At any time after registration, if the user chooses they can send more funds to the smart contract, but they can't move funds back out of it without the signatures of the other people pledged in the contract.

4. Depending on the settings, once in a specific period of time, or On demand the system will propse activities with which include 2 or more people who have pledged funds in the GTC contracts and which appear on each others "contact lists". The matching will also take in consideration the pledged funds, when generating the proposals. The user can then accept or deny the proposal. If the user denies a new proposal will be generated after a specified time.

5. If more than 2 users accept the proposal, the funds will be sent to another smart contract (the "let's go" contarct) from where they can only be used to pay for specific services (this part may not be viable to implement at this moment so won't be part of project exercs)

6. If the GTC contract funds are not used in 12 months since their deployment, they will be "burned" or sent to a smart contract which can provide funds to cover the fees of other people who can not afford to do a certain activity.


## Improvements 
Users will register with regular account by providing a list of activities the prefer, locations they wish to visit, favourite artists (spotify api), food etc.

Users  will receive notifications with proposed activities, based on their interests, distance willing to travel or region willing to travel to, and friends.
They will pledge their funds to a certain activity in the future.

**Good additional features to be added would be to automate the use of the pledge funds where possible. For example by making calls to booking, expedia, ticketmaster APIs and making a reservation, or buying tickets etc.
